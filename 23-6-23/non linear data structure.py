#Non linear data structure tree
to implement hierarchical data or information we use tree dtaa structure
 in a tree every node can have n no.of children
height of node:
    look down count the levels
depth of node:
    look up and count the levels
if a parent is having 2 children we call the children as left child and right child
tree can be divided into 2 parts:
    left sub tree
    right sub tree
    note:whenever we perform any operqation in tree we have to complete left
    sub tree first then we move ahead with right sub tree
leaf node:
    a node having 0 children
